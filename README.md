# Msc_UefiHda_PreOs_Accessibility
This is the sample code developed during my Msc, where I created a UEFI application capable of processing sound streams at UEFI environment


Code in action can be found at 4 videos, being:

Initial tests, to check the communication with the codec using HDA Immediate Registers, and using the Codec's Beep Generator

Play of a random stream buffer, just to check the execution of the stream by the DMA controllers in action

Play of a song, but due to misunderstanding the controller and codec were not configured correctly

Song being played correctly at UEFI environment (This song's name is "Zero", from the brazilian havy metal band "Dr Sin")

Ps.: Sorry for the bad quality videos, this will be inproved in future.
